# Sleeping Student Detector (Classroom AI Project)
This repository contains a student sleep detection project powered by MMAction2, designed for classroom monitoring and research applications.

The project focuses on:

* Video Sleep Detection: This script processes classroom video streams (such as lecture recordings or live webcam feeds) to detect when a student is sleeping. When detected, the system highlights the event and records the timestamp for further analysis.

* Image Sleep Detection: This script processes individual images or extracted frames, identifying sleeping students. The system can be used to analyze still classroom photos or dataset images for research purposes.
